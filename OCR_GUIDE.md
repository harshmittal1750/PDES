# 🔍 OCR Guide - Extract Text from Scanned PDFs

Your PDF Data Extractor now includes **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to handle scanned PDFs and image-based documents where text isn't selectable.

## 🎯 What is OCR?

OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a technology that "reads" text from images. When you have:

- Scanned documents
- PDFs created from photos
- Faxed documents
- Image-based PDFs where text isn't selectable

The OCR engine can convert these images back into searchable text.

## ⚡ How It Works

### 🔄 Automatic OCR (Recommended)

1. **Smart Detection**: The app first tries normal text extraction
2. **Auto-Switch**: If very little text is found (< 50 chars/page), it automatically uses OCR
3. **Best of Both**: Uses whichever method gives better results
4. **No User Action**: Completely automatic for the best experience

### 🔧 Manual OCR Control

- **Auto OCR**: ✅ Checked (default) - Let the system decide
- **Force OCR**: ☐ Unchecked - Force OCR on all PDFs regardless

## 📋 When to Use Each Option

### Auto OCR ✅ (Default - Recommended)

**Use when:** You have mixed PDF types

- ✅ Fast processing for normal PDFs
- ✅ Automatic OCR for scanned PDFs
- ✅ Best performance overall
- ✅ Perfect for batch processing mixed documents

### Force OCR 🔧 (Manual Override)

**Use when:**

- PDFs look normal but have extraction issues
- You want to ensure maximum text extraction
- Dealing with low-quality text rendering
- Need to double-check difficult documents

**Note:** Force OCR is much slower but more thorough

## 🎯 Perfect OCR Use Cases

### 📄 Scanned Invoices

- Old paper invoices scanned to PDF
- Faxed invoices received as images
- Mobile phone photos of receipts
- **Search for:** Invoice numbers, amounts, vendor names

### 📋 Legal Documents

### 🎯 Accuracy Expectations

- **High-Quality Scans**: 95-99% accuracy
- **Medium Quality**: 85-95% accuracy
- **Poor Quality**: 70-85% accuracy
- **Handwriting**: Limited support (printed text works best)

### 📊 Progress Tracking

- Real-time status: "OCR processing filename.pdf - Page 3/10"
- Visual progress bar for batch processing
- Results show `[OCR]` indicator for processed files

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting OCR

### ❌ "OCR failed for page X"

**Causes:**

- Extremely low quality image
- Page with no readable text
- Complex layouts or graphics

**Solutions:**

- Continue processing (other pages may work)
- Check original PDF quality
- Try pre-processing the PDF in another tool

### ⚠️ "No OCR text found"

**Causes:**

- Page is blank or graphics-only
- Text is too small or distorted
- Inverted colors (white on black)

**Solutions:**

- Normal behavior for non-text pages
- Results will show extraction method used
- Check PDF manually if needed

### 🐌 "OCR is very slow"

**Causes:**

- High-resolution images in PDF
- Many pages to process
- Complex page layouts

**Solutions:**

- ✅ This is normal for OCR processing
- ✅ Progress bar shows current status
- ✅ Processing happens in background
- ⏸️ You can continue using other apps

## 📊 Excel Output with OCR

### 🔍 How to Identify OCR Results

- **Method Column**: Shows "OCR" vs "Normal"
- **Results Display**: Shows `[OCR]` indicator
- **Context**: OCR text may have different formatting

### 📈 OCR Quality Indicators

- **Character Count**: OCR results often longer due to spacing
- **Special Characters**: May introduce extra spaces or symbols
- **Formatting**: OCR text is usually plain text without original formatting

## 🎯 Pro Tips for Best OCR Results

### 📄 PDF Quality

- ✅ **300 DPI or higher** scans work best
- ✅ **Black text on white background** is optimal
- ✅ **Straight pages** (not rotated or skewed)
- ❌ Avoid very small fonts (< 8pt)

### 🔍 Search Strategy for OCR

- ✅ Use **broader search terms** (OCR may have slight variations)
- ✅ Try **partial matches** instead of exact phrases
- ✅ **Case insensitive** searches work better with OCR
- ✅ Use **regex patterns** for flexible matching

### ⚡ Batch Processing

- 🔄 **Mix OCR and Normal** files in same batch
- 📊 **Start small** with 10-20 files to test OCR quality
- ⏰ **Plan for extra time** if many files need OCR
- 💾 **Save results frequently** for large OCR batches
