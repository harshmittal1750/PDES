## Pro Tips for Best Results

âœ… **Start Small**: Test with 5-10 files before processing thousands  
âœ… **Use Exact Terms**: Search for exact text you see in PDFs  
âœ… **Enable Context**: Keep "Include Context" checked for better results  
âœ… **Case Insensitive**: Usually works better than case-sensitive  
âœ… **Whole Words**: Use for cleaner results (e.g., "Total" not "total amount")
