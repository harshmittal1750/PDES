## ‚ö° Performance Tips

### For Large Batches (1000+ files):

1. **Increase RAM**: Close other applications to free memory
2. **Use SSD Storage**: Faster file access improves performance
3. **Limit Search Terms**: Fewer terms = faster processing
4. **Disable Context**: Turn off context extraction for maximum speed
5. **Process in Chunks**: Split very large batches into smaller groups

### Optimize Search Patterns:

- Use **exact text** for fastest results
- **Whole words** is faster than partial matches
- **Case sensitive** searches are slightly faster
- **Regex patterns** are slowest but most powerful

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Application won't start:**

- Check Python version: `python --version` (needs 3.8+)
- Install missing dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Try running with: `python -m pdf_extractor`

**PDF files not processing:**

- Ensure PDFs are not password-protected
- Check file permissions (read access required)
- Verify PDFs contain extractable text (not just images)

**Out of memory errors:**

- Process fewer files at once
- Close other applications
- Increase system RAM if possible
- Use "whole words" instead of partial matches

**No matches found:**

- Check spelling of search terms
- Try case-insensitive search
- Use partial words instead of whole words
- Test with a known PDF first

**Excel export fails:**

- Ensure Excel file isn't already open
- Check write permissions to save location
- Try saving to a different folder
- Verify available disk space

## üîß Advanced Features

### Regular Expression Examples:

```regex
\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}        # Find dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
\$[\d,]+\.?\d*           # Find dollar amounts
[A-Z]{2,3}-\d{3,6}       # Find reference numbers
\b[A-Z][a-z]+\s[A-Z][a-z]+ # Find names (First Last)
```

### Batch Processing Tips:

- Process similar document types together
- Use consistent search terms across batches
- Save results with descriptive filenames
- Keep backups of original PDFs

## üìù Technical Details

### Dependencies:
